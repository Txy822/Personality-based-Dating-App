# Personality-based-Dating-App

# Personality based Dating Application using NLP from Twitter Tweets

- This dating application is simple and smart to predict your personality from tweets which can be used to find matches around you area.
- The uses trained model using Natural Language Processing(NLP)-Transformers to predict 16 - MBTI personality type.
- The user can like and dislike or swipe right and  left based of their preference using location, personality type, and other details of other users. 
- Once the match is found the user be able to chat to facilitate communications.

 - Backstory: This app adds features of predicting personality from users of  large tweets(texts) which integrates android application with machine learning to make apps more smart. The app also has features which are helpful to find love ones and even make friends and be able to communicate.
 - It can be expanded and more features can be added. So if I feel to add more features or add new personality classifier model with better accuracy I will update it. Please use this resource for learning purpose only.
